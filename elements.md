		<p>After I got my media and communications degree, I worked as a translator and copywriter in Serbia. I took part in the organization of hospitality and communication for an international creative tech festival, which got me exposed to the creative use of machine learning methods and gave me a chance to meet tech-savvy creative professionals that challenged my idea of what was possible. As I was getting increasingly reliant on spell checking and grammar tools that ML methods myself, I became interested in the future of content creation and the nature of work in this new environment. I am also interested in the evolving world of business intelligence and data ethics, as well as the effects of technology on human psychology (in particular, the attention economy). I am an avid researcher, and I will explore almost any subject related to my interests.</p>
