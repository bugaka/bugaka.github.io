		<p>After I got my media and communications degree, I worked as a translator and copywriter in Serbia. At one point, I took part in the organization of hospitality and communication for an international creative tech festival that got me exposed to algorithmic (generative) art and deep learning, which gave me a chance to meet many tech-savvy creative professionals that challenged my idea of what was possible. As I was getting increasingly reliant on spell checking and grammar tools that used machine learning methods myself, I became interested in the future of content creation and the nature of work in this new environment. I am also interested in the evolving world of business intelligence and data ethics, as well as in the effects of technology on human psychology (in particular, the attention economy). I am an avid researcher when it comes to business and tech, and I will explore almost any related subject.</p>
